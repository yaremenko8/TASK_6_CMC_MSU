# Project â„–6
In May 2016 I was assigned with this adorable little task that was intended to test my knowledge of computational methods for evaluating definite integrals and solving equations as well as my skill of integrating assembley modules into a C program. I took the task very seriously, so hopefully it will serve as a decent example for beginners in computational mathematics and such. Unfortunately they made comment and document the whole thing in Russian.
